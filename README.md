# Assignment Week 4 - Handling Complex Images

This is one of the coursera assigment provided in the Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning course. This assignment is about handling complex images, where we are needed to use the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad and create a convolutional neural network that trains to 100% accuracy on these images, which cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999.
