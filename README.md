# Coursera Assignment - Handling Complex Images

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning course in the week 4 section where it discusses Using Real-world Images. This assignment is about handling complex images, where we are needed to use the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad and create a convolutional neural network that trains to 100% accuracy on these images, which cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999.
